# MFES - Stack Overflow
A repository for the Stack Overflow project for the MFES subject.

**Description**

In this project you should model all the information managed by the Stack Overflow website. This website presents questions and answers on a large number of computer programming topics. The website serves as a platform for users to ask questions and respond to them. But in addition they can, through registration and active participation, vote on more or less useful questions and answers.

**Deliverables**

The project should be organized in a way similar to the Vending Machine example (see the MFES page in Moodle). The practical work should be concluded and the deliverables (final report, VDM++ project files, UML project files) submitted in a .zip file through Moodle until 11pm January 3. It may be applied a penalty of 2 (points out of 20) for each day late. The presentations will be scheduled for
the first week of January (4th or 5th of January). Presentation is mandatory for ALL students. If you miss presentation you will get zero points out of twenty.
